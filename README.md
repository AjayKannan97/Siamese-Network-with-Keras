# Siamese Network with Keras

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a **Siamese Neural Network** using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. The model is designed for **one-shot learning**, where it can identify whether two given images belong to the same class or not.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a **Siamese Network** for similarity-based image classification.
- Train the model on **paired image datasets**.
- Use **contrastive loss** to improve model accuracy.
- Evaluate the network's performance on unseen data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Keras with TensorFlow backend
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `keras`
  - `opencv-python` (for image processing)
  - `scikit-learn`

## How It Works
1. **Input Data**: The model takes two images as input and passes them through **identical convolutional networks** to generate feature embeddings.
2. **Feature Comparison**: The embeddings are compared using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
3. **Contrastive Loss**: The model is optimized to minimize the distance for similar pairs and maximize it for dissimilar pairs.
4. **Prediction**: The network predicts whether the two images belong to the same class.

## Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Base**: Uses multiple **Conv2D** and **MaxPooling** layers to extract features.
- **Shared Weights**: Both branches of the network share identical weights.
- **Distance Calculation**: Uses Euclidean distance or L1 distance to compare embeddings.
- **Final Classification**: Uses a contrastive loss function.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras opencv-python scikit-learn
```

### Running the Model
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AjayKannan97/Siamese-Network-with-Keras.git
   cd Siamese-Network-with-Keras
   ```
2. **Prepare the dataset**: Place image pairs in the `dataset/` directory.
3. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. **Test the model**:
   ```bash
   python test.py --image1 path/to/image1 --image2 path/to/image2
   ```

## Results & Observations
- Achieved **high accuracy** in identifying similar and dissimilar image pairs.
- **Contrastive loss function** effectively minimized intra-class variance.
- Improved generalization by **data augmentation** and **regularization** techniques.
- Works well for **face verification, signature recognition, and handwriting similarity detection**.

## Applications
- **Face Verification** (e.g., One-shot learning for facial recognition)
- **Handwriting Similarity Detection**
- **Signature Verification**
- **Biometric Authentication**
